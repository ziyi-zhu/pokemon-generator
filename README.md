# Pokemon Generator

Generating Pokemon with a generative adversarial network.

## Introduction

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are one of the most interesting ideas in computer science today. Two models are trained simultaneously by an adversarial process. A generator learns to create images that look real, while a discriminator learns to tell real images apart from fakes. This project aims to use a deep convolutional GAN to generate Pokemons and classify their types. Visit the website at <a href="https://ziyizhu.me/pokemon-generator/">Pokemon Generator</a>.

## Dependencies

Install Express in the `root` directory and save it in the dependencies list. For example:

```sh
npm install express --save
```

To install Express temporarily and not add it to the dependencies list:

```sh
npm install express --no-save
```
